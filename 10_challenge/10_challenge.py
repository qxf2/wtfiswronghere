We will use this script to teach Python to absolute beginners
The script is an example of Fizz-Buzz implemented in Python

The FizzBuzz problem: 
For all integers between 1 and 99 (include both):
    # print fizz for multiples of 3
    # print buzz for multiples of 5 
    # print fizzbuzz for multiples of 3 and 5"
