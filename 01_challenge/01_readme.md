Read through the error message to start with. The error message was descriptive and understood that it was a syntax error at line no 27 that has to be fixed.

I at once understood the fix, when i opened the python file that had the issue. But was not remembering where to start and how to go about running the code. Had re-visited the git tutorial in PVT-04 ticket of how to fix issues with git bash and Visual studio code. That clearly guided me with the steps to fix python issues.
Many thanks!    
    
I refreshed my memory of the git commands learned during sprint 1 and had a hands on experience of fixing a bug with this ticket.
